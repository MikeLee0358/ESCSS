# ESCSS - "The Intersection of Wind and Destiny"
*Why have you drifted here, wanderer?*  
*Your figure is shrouded in the silence of wailing.*  
***For many years... the silver bullet people have been seeking, is it a dream? Or an illusion?***  
*Awaken, awaken, break free from the shackles of the past.*  
*Awaken, awaken, the silver bullet shining in the darkness.*
